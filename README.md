# super-basic-calculator

### About

This calculator web app was created using React. It calculates full equations using traditional PMDAS (does not use exponents) order of operations (Ex: `(20+30)รท5` returns `10`).

This is my first useful React app that I have created after taking Andrei Neagoie's Udemy course: [The Complete Web Developer in 2021: Zero to Mastery](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-developer-zero-to-mastery/).

### Usage
